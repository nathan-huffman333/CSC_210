Please write your answers in a file called "answers.txt" with your names
at the top in this repository. Please number each answer.

1. Why is bubble sort slower than selection sort and insertion sort?
Please explain your answer (succinctly).

2. Why do two sort methods with the same Big-O still differ in performance?

3. What property does a custom class need to have for it to be usable in a list with the three sort methods you implemented? Give a name to the concept and also explain specifically in Python what would need to be implemented. Depending on your background with Python this may require some research.

4. Why is Python's built-in sort so much faster than any of our implementations in this assignment? Is it primarily because it is better optimized, or is it something more fundamental?
