# Assignment 9

In this assignment you will implement dijkstra() on a weighted graph using an adjacency list with a Priority Queue. In addition, you will create a test case of your own.

## Basic Instructions

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top of the page
2. Add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on your **private** repository.
3. Implement the missing parts where it says "YOUR CODE HERE"
4. Test it on your local computer by following the build directions below
5. Push your code to GitHub. Every push will be automatically tested through a GitHub Action.
6. Submit the URL to your private repository on Canvas.

## Provided Files

@files you should modify

- `README.md` this file
- `LICENSE` MIT License
- `weighted_graph.py` @ Weighted Graph that contains dijkstra()
- `tests.py` @ the unit tests to prove your code works

## Testing

You can run all of the unit tests in the current directory by running:

```
python -m unittest discover
```

You can also run tests.py directly:

```
python tests.py
```
